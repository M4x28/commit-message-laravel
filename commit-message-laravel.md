# Commit Message Roules for Laravel Project
Here I'm going to specify the convention for the commit message in a Laravel project. <br>
This document was made to help organization and working group to provide more effective commit message and improve the workflow.
---
>By the way this document will be in continuous development to keep up with the framework changes.

### The commit message should be structured as follows:
```
<type>[optional scope]: [<branch>] <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
